# A Living Wage As A Basic Human Right: People as Data Collectors, Experience Aggregators & Novelty Generators

## "Economy is run by a network of command economies called corporations. What goes on internal to a corporation or a mega corporation is not free trade, it is command economy."
### - Noam Chomsky

The current world Economy as a network of corporations has undeniable issues: Poverty is commonplace in poorer countries, in richer countries the wealth gap increasingly widens, pollution has become hazardous in many areas of the world, resources are being depleted at an unsustainable rate, population growth continues to cause the issues to expand, and countries go through boom and bust cycles which can have staggering effects on the well-being of their residents. This is evidence that the economic foundation upon which Humanity is building a global civilization is faulty and unstable. As human population increases the effects of each of these issues is magnified upon each individual until the point that they become untenable. We refer to this state as poverty. The largest, poorest portion of the world population feels the effects first - poverty is widespread in many poorer countries in present times as well as in pockets of wealthier countries. As wealth continues to centralize in these countries, these pockets will spread and connect as the population at large becomes poorer.

## "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it."
### - Albert Einstein

Compound interest is what allows for the centralization of wealth. It has been weaponized by the wealthiest individuals to attack the rest of Humanity, who have been largely unaware of the negative side effects of their lifestyle due to the positive side effects which the current economic model also creates. These positive side effects increase the quality of life for a small portion of Humanity and can distract them from the disparity which is created. There are certainly many positives which the current model has created - longer lifespans, global transportation and communication networks, a higher access to goods and so on - which are not to be looked down upon. The corporations have had many positive effects on Humanity in that they helped advanced Humanity to a technological point that will allow for the accumulating negatives to be overcome. The problems presented by the negatives can be solved with the contemporary state of knowledge if current technologies are applied appropriately.

## "Either war is obsolete or men are."
### - R. Buckminster Fuller

It is apparently impossible to overcome the privilidges that exploitation of compound interest has afforded to the wealthy in the current environment. The wealth is distributed amongst enough individuals within the wealthy class that the altruism of any one person towards the rest of Humanity only slows the process of centralization. Since there has not been a concentrated effort by the wealthy to correct the problems caused by the negatives since they have come to light globally, it is evident the attack via compound interest is not inadvertent and is meant to continue. The rest of Humanity cannot solely turn compound interest against the wealthy as a means of defense. The system of money which is presently used to control resources is owned by that class and thus they can change the rules of the system to their needs, preventing any meaningful counter-attack through that vector.

## "The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."
### - Sun Tzu

Continued negligence of the benefits of the economic model due to the distractions they cause will allow the negatives to erode the benefits to the point where they are outweighed for all but the wealthy. They will then develop further power as the poorer people have less and less capital with which to help themselves while compound interest continues to take its share annually, the law preventing any. A direct counter-attack against the current system will only exacerbate the problems that the rest of Humanity faces through resource depletion; a siege in reverse from gated communities.

## "There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare."
### - Sun Tzu

Paradoxically, inaction leaves the rest of Humanity increasingly vulerable to traditional threats from nature and from one another, which the benefits of the command economy have presently removed in varying degrees per person based solely on luck and their birthplace. If the above holds true, then a strategic mind would indeed see inciting and perpetuating such conflict as a checkmate move for the wealthy as they would benefit from the collective efforts of all Humanity up until this point with access to nearly unlimited resources, while allowing the rest of Humanity to weaken itself to the point of defeat.

## "Responsibility I believe accrues through privilege. People like you and me have an unbelievable amount of privilege and therefore we have a huge amount of responsibility. We live in free societies where we are not afraid of the police; we have extraordinary wealth available to us by global standards. If you have those things, then you have the kind of responsibility that a person does not have if he or she is slaving seventy hours a week to put food on the table; a responsibility at the very least to inform yourself about power. Beyond that, it is a question of whether you believe in moral certainties or not."
### - Noam Chomsky

Individuals who had the good fortune to be born in the countries which are centralizing the wealth have enjoyed a relatively high standard of living due to the benefits of the command economy, compared to those from which the wealth is taken. It is interesting to note that it becomes plaininly evident that 'wealth' is actually the natural resources of the Earth, including talented individuals and their work. Benefits such as education, healthcare, access to modern technology, public safety and entertainment have all been provided for the general public in what are considered 'First World Countries' by present standards. This may be seen as the overflow from the wealth-saturated individuals in the class above. To have the lower class capable, content and healthy ensures that the upper class will benefit from their activities with minimal risk - they do after all regain it from someone along the way in the lower class through compound interest and taxation. This has persisted for approximately a century in the first-world - feeding off the resources brought by expansion of the rich countries' industry into the countries which had been colonized in prior eras.

## "The more dynamic the capitalistic expansion, the greater the disparity. It is from the disparity that we are going to get all the political upheaval for the next few years."
### - Robert D. Kaplan

Others are not as fortunate, in 'Developing and 'Third World Countries' an individual may have little to no access to some or all of those benefits. As the benefits saturate the first-world countries, the developing and third-world begin to gain access to them. Gaining access to the benefits in this way brings them unevenly; for example modern technology has come to many countries before public safety systems develop. This has proven to make the negative effects of the command economy more visible to individuals accustomed to an even pace of development. As such, war, poverty, pollution and disease have become commonplace and - very importantly - highly visible through the technology. This revelation has rightfully angered members from all of the non-wealthy classes. Unfortunately the anger is often misguided through various mechanisms of nationalistic, religious and cultural propaganda away from the wealthy to create infighting between and within the poorer classes.

## "Before you enter the world, you will pick one ball from a barrel of 6.8 billion. That ball will determine your gender, race, nationality, natural abilities, and health ï¿½ whether you are born rich or poor, sick or able-bodied, brilliant or below average, American or Zimbabwean."
### - Warren Buffet

Many people from the first-world have responded to their own sense of anger or injustice in ways which their individual privilidge allows: activism, socially concious consumerism, volunteerism, journalism etc. In recent years, technological advancements have become available across all classes which have enabled communication and collaboration between individuals in ways that were not previously possible. People from all countries can communicate and work together - individuals can share the benefits and understandings gained from their respective privilidges and perspectives with one another almost instantaneously. It is through this technology that the non-wealthy classes can shift the global system of resource management out from under the dominant hold of the command economy into a Data Driven Democratic Open-Source model which can serve as the foundation from which an egalitarian and meritocratic society can arise. The luck of the draw will no longer determine an individual's potential within society.

## "It is now highly feasible to take care of everybody on Earth at a higher standard of living than any have ever known. It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary. War is obsolete. It is a mater of converting the high technology from weaponry to livingry."
### - R. Buckminster Fuller

This new resource management system will replace government and the command economy with pure democracy and capitalism via distributed open-source internet technology. It will serve as the framework for a classless society and provides a base living wage as a fundamental human right. The presence of government inherently introduces segregation by creating a 'government' and 'citizen' class, in which the government has artifical control over the rights of the citizens and local resources. Similarly, the presence of a corporate class has allowed for businesses to hold the same rights as humans which has created abstract entites which exist solely for profit generation with no concern for the side effects. Therefore the model necessarily prevents ursury lending and incorporation. History from many cultures undeniably shows that the corruptable nature of individual humans proves the traditional paradigm of government to be vulnerable of attempts to centralize power and wealth, which in turn endangers the citizens and thus Humanity's well being.

## "In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model. You create a new model and make the old one obsolete."
### R. Buckminster Fuller

The core belief of the new resource management system is that the most valuable natural resource is Human Experience. The succsessive systems up until now have all enabled a subsection of humanity to collect enough resources to develop new ways to expand their ability to experience novel things. Advancements in medicine extend lifespans which lengthens the temporal experience of an individual. Technological advancements enhance an individual's capacity for experiences beyond the limits of what their unaided body can percieve. Societal advancements free individuals from their basic needs which allows for a shift in attention away from the immediate, physical world to abstraction, invention, and artistry. Until recently this individual experiential data was rather intangible and was naturally shared in a manner that was subject to the sensory interpretation of the person observing it, their willingness to explain their experience to others, and their capacity for descriptive language with which to express their observations. Now an individual can equip themselves with sensory devices which can collect this data in an objective way and share it with other systems for analysis. These systems are where the value from an individual's experiential data is derived. Therefore, a person earns their base living wage merely by existing and allowing for a certain amount of data collection.

## "I think people should be allowed to do anything they want. We haven't tried that for a while. Maybe this time it'll work."
### - George Carlin

An individual can choose to participate further; by expanding the system, by creating new things for others to experience, or by furthering their contribution to data collection they expand their capacity to earn. Just like with money, an individual can also choose a path of non-participation although it intrinsically brings with it the same difficulties of eschewing money in present society. An individual may suspend or enable their participation and thus collection of data and earnings at will, instantly and as frequently or infrequently as desired. An individual with nothing else, for a day's minimal amount of participation in the resource management system, will earn enough to survive for that day. The minimal amount of participation will be defined democratically through an open-source voting system and must be provided for each individual alive. Observing the amount of information technology devices which exist in modern times and the rate at which they become obsolete and are discared, it does not seem out of the realm of possibility to equip all of Humanity with devices which can record basic vital signs, provide location awareness, network connectivity and a small amount of processing power and storage. Since each experience is unique, the data collected will be unique and thus valuable for further analysis. When viewed from a societal level, this data about an individual can lead to a massive increase in efficiency for public services and thus savings in many dimensions of a society's cost and risk model. From predictive diagnoses and preventative healthcare to crowdsourced translation of every sign on the planet to more effective disaster response to the automation of traffic, the amount of value possible to be extracted from this type of basic data is immense. As individuals develop the system further and enrich it with more and more data, the potential analyses become innumerable.
