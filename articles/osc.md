# Open Source Corporation

An open source corporation is a semi-autonomous economic entity which provides a framework of tasks for employment-at-will of other economic entities, human or otherwise.

The framework consists of a strategy - a clear, quantifiable goal and associated projects which shall accomplish it. Each project is a set of work contracts for consumption by the lowest bidder within an allotted bidding period, to be completed within an allotted work period.

A work contract provides a set of criteria for completion which are testable to allow for test-driven development of the open source corporation's strategy. The testing itself is another work contract to be performed by a certified entity. If the work passes the criteria, the bidder is paid the amount for which the contract is issued. The contract benefits from providing specificity and a complete test suite - it may vary from anything from 'build a road using  asphalt defined by the plans %blueprints% by November 1, 2020' to 'Give me a heart transplant as soon as possible' to 'Geocode a list of 1,000,000 addresses within 30 seconds'.

Work contracts may be restricted to various bidders by certification/verification. For example time-critical work contracts may only go to bidders which are verified to possess the necessary resources to complete the contract within the allotted work period. Another example being work contracts which involve a civil engineering task only showing to bidders who employ someone certified as an engineer. An individual bidder can be considered to employ themselves.

The open source corporation benefits from providing highly granular work contracts, as bidders of all sizes and locations may complete them. Various means of searchability can be added to contracts: tags, full text descriptions, social graphs etc. It is up to the open source corporation to decide upon and implement the best means of advertisement to accomplish its strategy.
